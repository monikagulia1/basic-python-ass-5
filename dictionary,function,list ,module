8. How do you "pretty print" dictionary values using which module and function?

answers-
  1. An empty dictionary's code looks like this:
```python
my_dict = {}
```

2. The value of a dictionary with the key 'foo' and the value 42 would be represented as:
```python
my_dict = {'foo': 42}
```

3. The most significant distinction between a dictionary and a list is how they store and access data. 

- A dictionary is an unordered collection of key-value pairs, where each key is unique. It uses a hash table implementation, allowing for efficient retrieval of values based on their associated keys. Dictionary keys can be of any immutable type, such as strings, numbers, or tuples.
- On the other hand, a list is an ordered collection of elements. It stores elements sequentially and allows duplicate values. List elements are accessed by their index, which is an integer value.

4. If you try to access `spam['foo']` when `spam` is `{'bar': 100}`, you would get a `KeyError`. The key `'foo'` does not exist in the `spam` dictionary, so attempting to access it will raise an error.

5. If a dictionary is stored in `spam`, the expression `'cat' in spam` checks if the key `'cat'` exists in the dictionary. It returns `True` if the key is present and `False` otherwise.

   On the other hand, the expression `'cat' in spam.keys()` also checks if the key `'cat'` exists in the dictionary, but it does so by explicitly accessing the dictionary's keys using the `keys()` method. The result is the same as the previous expression, returning `True` if the key is present and `False` otherwise.

6. If a dictionary is stored in `spam`, the expression `'cat' in spam` checks if the key `'cat'` exists in the dictionary. It returns `True` if the key is present and `False` otherwise.

   The expression `'cat' in spam.values()` checks if the value `'cat'` exists in the dictionary's values. It returns `True` if the value is present and `False` otherwise.

7. A shortcut for the given code is to use the `setdefault()` method of dictionaries:
```python
spam.setdefault('color', 'black')
```
This method checks if the key `'color'` exists in the dictionary. If it does, it returns the corresponding value. If it doesn't exist, it adds the key-value pair `'color': 'black'` to the dictionary.

8. To "pretty print" dictionary values, you can use the `pprint` module's `pprint()` function. Here's an example:
```python
import pprint

my_dict = {'name': 'John', 'age': 30, 'city': 'New York'}
pprint.pprint(my_dict)
```
This function displays the dictionary in a formatted and readable way, making it easier to visualize its structure.
